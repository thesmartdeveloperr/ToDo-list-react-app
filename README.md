# A ToDo web app in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I learnt about react hooks, components, states, etc with this project.

## Using React Router

I have also used react router in the project for certain tasks(basically going back and forth between adding new todos and the main todo list page), it is the main thing which makes this a SPA app.
